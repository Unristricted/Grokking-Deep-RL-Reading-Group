# Reinforcement Learning Reading Group

This repository contains implementations and experiments from our Reinforcement Learning reading group, covering fundamental RL algorithms and concepts through practical implementations.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into four main sections, each focusing on different aspects of reinforcement learning:

### DQN (Deep Q-Networks)
Implementation of DQN applied to the Brick Breaker game environment. Features both TensorFlow and PyTorch implementations with various improvements and refinements.

### MDP (Markov Decision Processes)
Comprehensive collection of MDP algorithm implementations, including multi-armed bandits and classic RL environments.

### PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
Implementation of PPO demonstrated on the CartPole environment from OpenAI Gym.

### TorchRL
Educational notebooks exploring TorchRL's capabilities and implementation details.


## Getting Started

Each folder contains its own detailed README with specific setup instructions and implementation details. The implementations progress from fundamental concepts (MDPs) to more advanced algorithms (PPO).

## Prerequisites

- PyTorch
- TensorFlow (for some DQN implementations)
